# CSS-practice
Repo of CSS projects tied to a Udemy course, used to practice Git.

Each phase of the course is represented by a folder. These phases introduce new concepts that are then incorporated into a larger class project. I originally thought there would be separate projects for each phase which is why this repo is organized in this manner. A version-like branch/tagged commit system would have been more appropriate.

The naming of the folders correspond to the lesson of that section. The contents are source files for the project itself, as well as smaller supporting projects.
